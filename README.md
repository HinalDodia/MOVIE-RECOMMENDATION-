# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** built using **Machine Learning** and **Streamlit**.  
The system recommends movies similar to the one selected by the user by calculating **cosine similarity** on movie feature vectors.  

The frontend is implemented with **Streamlit**, and recommended movies are displayed with 🎬 **posters**, ⭐ **IMDb ratings**, and 📅 **release year**, fetched in real-time from the **OMDb API**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Select a movie from a dropdown list
- Get **Top 5 similar movie recommendations**
- Display of:
  - 🎬 Movie Poster
  - ⭐ IMDb Rating
  - 📅 Year of Release
- Netflix-style UI with posters arranged side by side
- Simple and interactive **web app** interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Pickle** (for saving trained data)
- **Streamlit** (for frontend UI)
- **OMDb API** (for posters, ratings, year)
- **Cosine Similarity** (for recommendation engine)
